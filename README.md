## what is Github - and what is in our Github repository
Your digital "zettelkasten."
A zettelkasten is a german word which basically means slip box. 
It comes from a time when you would write your research notes on index cards. The idea that each index card would contain a cited quote or idea that would be stored in the box for reference later to write papers. 
We are not going to take such a strict and ordered approach to our zettelkasten here, but more on that later.

## What goes in it
Your readings. 
notes
quotes
your own blogs or ideas
links
podcasts
videos
class notes
fanfiction
memes 
whatever
you can even put your assignemnts in there - which might not be a bad idea to back them up both for your sake and mine. 

Remember, not all of this has to go to the group repo. You can keep some/all of them just in your own "local" version or you can share some/all of it by 




2. How to use it

## Why - this is not a grade

This is not for your grade. You will not be penalized for not using this. 
You can only be helped. 

It is a great resource for future you: you can have these files forever. I won't delete this repository so they can always sit here if you ever want to come back to them. 

You can share with your classmates. 

Besides the readings, whatever goes in here, you can print off and use on the Midterm.  

So put whatever helps or is interesting to you. Work together. Share notes. Improve on each other's notes. 

This is also a great resource for those who are not to keen on speaking in class. 
I'm not going to make it a point to figure out usernames and track all of you - you all can choose anonymous usernames or just operate as yourselves.
In either case, if you choose an anonymous username but give me a heads up somehow about your username then I can be mindful of your participation on the site. 

So the more you guys mess around with this the better you come out looking.

I'm not putting any restrictions on what you put in there. Try anything. I of course have final say on what gets pushed to the Master so I'll filter out anything that does not seem apropriate. 

This is a technological skill. 
It's how texts work and are collaborated on nowadays, especially if you do any coding. 

To some of you, this may sound complicated,
but can it really be as bad as Blackboard?
I think not. 

Just mess around with it. All the data is safe, so if you mess up, that's ok. Everything will still be there. Just try again.

Just be smart. If you have assignments, just keep a spare copy somewhere.
I'm not going to accept the excuse "Github ate my homework" as a reason why I didn't get your assignment on time. 
But I don't think that can really happen.
As long as I have been writing on Github - I've messed up ROYALLY quite a bit and have never lost anything. 


## Issues

This a great way to communicate!
If there is something you don't get about a reading or an assignment etc. - of course you can email me and I can respond over email or we can meet up and discuss it. And for certain questions that will certainly be the best way to handle it. 
Another way to ask is through an "Issue" which will still go to my email, but will allow others of us in the class to see it as well. Maybe you are not the only person with this question/problem. Maybe others are just as confused but didn't feel like speaking up. If I can notice that is a bigger issue than I can devote class time to it. 
Also, maybe you have a question but don't feel like asking me directly about it. Use the issues and maybe your classmates will answer it. 

Like I said, I don't expect you to use this.
 
1) We just had this extra time because of the Wednesday schedule
2) I hate blackboard so I wanted to give you a better alternative that will exist beyond the class. I also hate forced class discussion boards, but I still wanted to give you a means to discuss if you really wanted to.
